        "The Pair Plot was chosen as it provides a comprehensive visual overview of relationships between multiple numerical features‚Äîspecifically nkill, nwound, property, and iyear. It displays scatter plots between each pair, enabling identification of correlations or trends, such as how casualties vary over time. The diagonal histograms show the distribution and concentration of values, helping detect skewness or outliers. This plot is particularly useful for spotting clusters, trends, or anomalies across time and damage metrics in a single frame. Such visualization is ideal during exploratory data analysis, guiding deeper investigation and feature selection for modeling or strategic decision-making."

        "The pair plot provides valuable insights into the relationship between fatalities, injuries, property damage, and time (year). A strong positive correlation is visible between the number of people killed (nkill) and wounded (nwound), suggesting that more deadly attacks often also result in more injuries. The time trend indicates a noticeable rise in both fatalities and injuries after the early 2000s, reflecting an escalation in the severity and frequency of attacks in recent decades. The property variable, which seems to be binary (likely indicating whether property damage occurred), shows that property damage has occurred in specific periods, likely aligning with high-fatality years. Most data points are clustered near the lower end of the casualty range, but the presence of a few outliers highlights some extremely deadly attacks. Overall, the pair plot helps identify both temporal trends and interdependencies between the variables, offering a holistic view of how the impact of terrorism has evolved."
